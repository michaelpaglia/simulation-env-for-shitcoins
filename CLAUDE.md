# Claude Code Instructions

Follow these guidelines when working on this project.

## Commits

Follow CONTRIBUTING.md strictly:

- **One feature = one commit** (atomic commits)
- **No AI attribution** - do not add `Co-Authored-By` lines
- **Simple format**: `type: short description`
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `ui`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`

### Examples
```
feat: add whale persona
fix: sentiment calculation overflow
ui: add token input form
```

### Don't
- Don't combine multiple features in one commit
- Don't add Co-Authored-By or AI attribution
- Don't use vague messages like "updates" or "wip"

## Code Style

- Use type hints
- Keep functions small and focused
- Add docstrings for public functions
